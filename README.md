# Ionic Angular Cordova Starter Kit

Welcome to the **Ionic Angular Cordova Starter Kit**! This starter kit is designed to help you quickly get started with building mobile applications using **Ionic**, **Angular**, and **Cordova**. It provides a solid foundation for creating cross-platform mobile applications, whether you're targeting **iOS**, **Android**, or the **Web**.

## Getting Started
## 1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tortucu/ionic-angular-cordova-starter-kit.git
cd ionic-angular-cordova-starter-kit
```
## 2. Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies for the project:
```bash
npm install
```
## 3. Serve the App in the Browser
To run the app in the browser for testing and development:
```bash
ionic serve
```
This will start a development server and open the app in your browser.
## 4. Run on a Mobile Device
You can run the app on a connected mobile device or an emulator using Cordova. First, ensure your mobile development environment is properly set up (either Android Studio for Android or Xcode for iOS). Then, use the following command:
### For Android:
```bash
ionic cordova platform add android
ionic cordova run android
```
### For iOS:
```bash
ionic cordova platform add ios
ionic cordova run ios
```
## 5. Build the App for Production
To build the app for production, use the following command:
```bash
ionic cordova build --prod
```
This will generate an optimized production build of the app for either Android or iOS.
## Folder Structure
The general folder structure for this starter kit is as follows:
```bash
/src
  /app              - Core app code (components, services, pages)
  /assets           - Static assets (images, icons, etc.)
  /environments     - Configuration for different environments (dev, prod)
  /theme            - Global styling and theme variables
```
## Customizing the App
You can customize the app by editing the following:
1. Pages: Modify or add new pages in /src/app/pages.
2. Services: Modify or create new services for API calls or data management in /src/app/services.
3. UI Components: Modify existing UI components or create your own in /src/app/components.
For styling, you can use CSS or SCSS files located in the /src/theme folder. Ionic uses a highly customizable design system with pre-built components, so you can easily adjust the app's look and feel.

## Testing
You can run unit tests using the following command:
```bash
ng test
```
For end-to-end testing, use:
```bash
ng e2e
```
## Deployment
After building the app for production, you can deploy it to the respective app stores:
- **Android**: Use Android Studio to upload the APK to the Google Play Store.
- **iOS**: Use Xcode to upload the app to the Apple App Store.
